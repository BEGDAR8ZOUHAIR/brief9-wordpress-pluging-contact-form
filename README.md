Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.
If for some reason this doesn’t work, don’t worry. It doesn’t work on all web hosts. Open up wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.
Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.
Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your wp-config.php file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the WordPress support forums with as much data as you can gather.
If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username, it will be admin.
The installer should then send you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on “Profile” to change the password.

Online Resources
If you have any questions that aren’t addressed in this document, please take advantage of WordPress’ numerous online resources:

The WordPress Codex
The Codex is the encyclopedia of all things WordPress. It is the most comprehensive source of information for WordPress available.
The WordPress Blog
This is where you’ll find the latest updates and news related to WordPress. Recent WordPress news appears in your administrative dashboard by default.
WordPress Planet
The WordPress Planet is a news aggregator that brings together posts from WordPress blogs around the web.
WordPress Support Forums
If you’ve looked everywhere and still can’t find an answer, the support forums are very active and have a large community ready to help. To help them help you be sure to use a descriptive thread title and describe your question in as much detail as possible.
WordPress IRC (Internet Relay Chat) Channel
There is an online chat channel that is used for discussion among people who use WordPress and occasionally support topics. The above wiki page should point you in the right direction. (irc.libera.chat #wordpress)
Final Notes
If you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the Support Forums.
WordPress has a robust plugin API (Application Programming Interface) that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the Plugin Developer Handbook. You shouldn’t modify any of the core code.
Share the Love
WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better—you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgeable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.

WordPress is the official continuation of b2/cafélog, which came from Michel V. The work has been continued by the WordPress developers. If you would like to support WordPress, please consider donating.
